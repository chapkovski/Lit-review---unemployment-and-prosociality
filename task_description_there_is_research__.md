task description

there is research showing that people become more prosocial when they receive welfare benefits. However only done with questionnaire items. This could be a research gap, showing this with monetary stakes
some unemployed take up labor which is not financially efficient for them. Are they more cooperative/prosocial?
Are people who become unemployed becoming more pessimistic regarding cooperativeness of other people?
Also possible would be group games, like unemployed with employed, refugees with residents etc.
