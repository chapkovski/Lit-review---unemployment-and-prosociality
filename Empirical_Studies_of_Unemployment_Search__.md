#[Empirical Studies of Unemployment: Search Behavior, Reintegration and Prevention](http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate\_000000013593/0\_dissertation\_AK\_vfinal\_online.pdf?hosts=local) \cite{krause_empirical_2013}.
She measured the chance of finding jobs in a population of unemployed. Several questions regarding their attitudes were asked:

* Risk attitudes: How do you estimate yourself personally: are you generally prepared to take risks or do you try to avoid risks?
* Time preferences: How do you regard yourself as an individual: are you someone who generally gets impatient or someone who always has a lot of patience?
* Trust: How do you regard yourself as an individual: are you someone who generally trusts others or are you someone who does not trust others?
* Reciprocity: To what extent does the following statement apply to you? I am prepared to accept costs to help someone who has helped me previously.


##Results:
No results with an exception of risk attitude. 
More risk averse individuals are less selective, i.e. that they have lower reservation wages â€“ which then lead to higher employment probabilities.
Time preferences, trust and  reciprocity **do not affect** the probability of being employed

##OLS Coefs:
Risk **-.009 (0.003)**

Time 0.004 (0.003)

Trust 0.003 (0.004)

Reciprocity 0.003 (0.005)
