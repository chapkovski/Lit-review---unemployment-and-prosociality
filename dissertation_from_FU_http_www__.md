 Risk attitudes: How do you estimate yourself personally: are you generally prepared
to take risks or do you try to avoid risks?
❼ Time preferences: How do you regard yourself as an individual: are you someone
who generally gets impatient or someone who always has a lot of patience?
❼ Trust: How do you regard yourself as an individual: are you someone who generally
trusts others or are you someone who does not trust others?
❼ Reciprocity: To what extent does the following statement apply to you? I am prepared
to accept costs to help someone who has helped me previously.

so, no results with an exception of risk attitude
we find support for the hypothesis that more risk averse individuals are
less selective, i.e. that they have lower reservation wages – which then lead to higher
employment probabilities.

Furthermore, we investigate in more detail the influence of time preferences, trust and
positive reciprocity on the probability of being employed at the first interview. In those
additional regressions, we individually include the three different measures for each of the
preferences and attitudes.24 Interestingly, and independently of the measure used, none
of the three characteristics exhibits significant explanatory power in these regressions.
The coefficient estimates on the indicator for second generation migrants remain virtually
the same in all regressions. It thus appears that among the preferences and attitudes
we examine, only the measures of risk attitudes enter statistically significantly in the
regressions. That is, risk attitudes explain the probability of being employed at the first
interview. Despite descriptive differences between natives and migrants, which are to
some extent present in the case of the three other preferences and attitudes, these do not
appear to significantly influence the employment probability – at least not beyond those
characteristics which are also controlled for in our regressions.
