#an article by Halvorsen about re-employment: Impact of Re-employment on Psychological Distress among Long-term Unemployed


Psychological difficulties, however, do not
necessarily right themselves with re-employment.
This may be due to the aftermath of previous
spells of unemployment (Fineman
1987). Fagin (1979) maintains that there
could be lasting personality changes as a result
of prolonged unemployment. For example, feelings
of low self-esteem can persist even after
re-employment (Kaufman 1982). Other researchers
have maintained that returning to
paid work can be distressing after longer periods
of unemployment (Liem & Liem 1988).

## results of Halvorsen
It has
been demonstrated, however, that differences
in psychological distress between the recurrently
unemployed and those insecurely reemployed
are not significant.

Pro-Social Behaviour of Unemployed Individuals - An Experimental Study

Homann, W. and Yilmaz, L., 2011. Pro-Social Behaviour of Unemployed Individuals-An Experimental Study. Available at SSRN 1851364.


## results
1. Only 37 percent of unemployed individuals maximise their own material pay-o§ . However, 63 percent have other-regarding preferences.
2. Result 2a Voluntary workers show signiÖcantly more solidarity than non- or forced workers.
3. Result 2b Voluntary workers expect signiÖcantly higher solidarity from their counterpart.
4. Result 2c There is a signiÖcant di§erence in the percentage of unemployed individuals who give nothing in the group of non- or forced workers (45 percent) compared with unemployed individuals who work voluntarily (25 percent).
5. Result 2d Among all the subjects who give nothing, there is a signiÖcant di§erence that only non- or forced unemployed individuals expect on average positive solidarity and all the voluntary workers expect zero solidarity from their counterpart.
6. Result 3 The degree of solidarity has a positive e§ect of the probability of working voluntarily in parallel to receiving unemployment beneÖts.
