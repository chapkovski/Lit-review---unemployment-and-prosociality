Homann, W. and Yilmaz, L., 2011. Pro-Social Behaviour of Unemployed Individuals-An Experimental Study. Available at SSRN 1851364.


## results
1. Only 37 percent of unemployed individuals maximise their own material pay-o§ . However, 63 percent have other-regarding preferences.
2. Result 2a Voluntary workers show signiÖcantly more solidarity than non- or forced workers.
3. Result 2b Voluntary workers expect signiÖcantly higher solidarity from their counterpart.
4. Result 2c There is a signiÖcant di§erence in the percentage of unemployed individuals who give nothing in the group of non- or forced workers (45 percent) compared with unemployed individuals who work voluntarily (25 percent).
5. Result 2d Among all the subjects who give nothing, there is a signiÖcant di§erence that only non- or forced unemployed individuals expect on average positive solidarity and all the voluntary workers expect zero solidarity from their counterpart.
6. Result 3 The degree of solidarity has a positive e§ect of the probability of working voluntarily in parallel to receiving unemployment beneÖts.
