According to the benchmark solution, expectations of positive help should
not change player 2’s optimal behavior. However, there exists evidence showing
that anticipation of help crowds out incentives to work (see Krueger and Meyer,
2002, for a literature review).

For example, in a recent study undertaken in
Canada and the United States for a large data set (50 years), Kuhn and Riddell
(2006) observed large and significant adverse effects of unemployment insurance
on labor supply.

On the other hand, Hausman (1985) and Atkinson (1995)
found small, though positive, effects of income transfers on labor supply

##one more result:
Anticipation of help behavior does not seem to crowd out incentives to work:
exerted effort remains constant across different help-amounts, but reacts optimally
to random events.

- that is, the amount of effort of the beneficiary remains the same not depending on amount transferred by the dictator (rich guy)
