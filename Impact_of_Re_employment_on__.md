#Impact of Re-employment on Psychological Distress among Long-term Unemployed \cite{Halvorsen_1998}
It has been demonstrated that differences in psychological distress between the recurrently unemployed and those insecurely reemployed
are not significant. 


# Pro-Social Behaviour of Unemployed Individuals - An Experimental Study \cite{Homann}
Solidarity game  \cite{Selten_1998} played with unemployed recruited in German unemployment centers (N=230).

They matched them in pairs, telling them that it is unknown whether a second person is employed or unemployed (to avoid in-group effect). Then they played a lottery with them - by rolling a dice, they had a chance to win either 10 euro or 0. The same happened with another partner. Before playing the lottery they could choose whether they would like to share some of their earnings if (and only if) they win and another person loses. The degree of prosociality (as always) was measured by the amount they'd like to donate to another participant.
 
##Results: 
1. They divided unemployed into three categories: a) those who just took their welfare benefits, and had no other voluntary jobs. b) those who were forced to work by the state. c) those who chose to participate in some voluntary activities.
2.  Voluntary workers show significantly more solidarity than non- or forced workers.
3. Voluntary workers expect significantly higher solidarity from their counterpart. (they elicited their beliefs about the decisions of others)
3. 45% of non- or forced workers gave nothing (0), and only 25% of those who work voluntary gave nothing.
