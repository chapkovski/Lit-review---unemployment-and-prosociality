#Impact of Re-employment on Psychological Distress among Long-term Unemployed \cite{Halvorsen_1998}
It has been demonstrated that differences in psychological distress between the recurrently unemployed and those insecurely reemployed
are not significant. 


# Pro-Social Behaviour of Unemployed Individuals - An Experimental Study \cite{Homann}
Solidarity game  \cite{Selten_1998} played with unemployed in Germany. 
##Results: 
1. They divided unemployed into three categories: a) those who just took their welfare benefits, and had no other voluntary jobs. b) those who were forced to work by the state. c) those who chose to participate in some voluntary activities.
2.  Voluntary workers show significantly more solidarity than non- or forced workers.
3. Voluntary workers expect significantly higher solidarity from their counterpart. (they elicited their beliefs about the decisions of others)
3. 45% of non- or forced workers gave nothing (0), and only 25% of those who work voluntary gave nothing.
