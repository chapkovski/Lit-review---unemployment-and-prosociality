4. есть ли игры с безработными/ или эмигрантами - или другими депривированными vs. другие группы (менее депривированные)

there is research showing that people become more prosocial when they receive welfare benefits. However only done with questionnaire items. This could be a research gap, showing this with monetary stakes
some unemployed take up labor which is not financially efficient for them. Are they more cooperative/prosocial?
Are people who become unemployed becoming more pessimistic regarding cooperativeness of other people?
Also possible would be group games, like unemployed with employed, refugees with residents etc.
