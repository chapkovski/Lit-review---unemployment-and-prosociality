#An experimental paper of charity effect on beneficiary
## On the relation between impulses to help and causes of neediness: An experimental study. \citet{Buitrago_2009}
Two-person game, with inequality of endowments. A 'poor' guy could choose the level of efforts. After that a 'rich' participant played a dictator's game. In some treatments he could observe if the 'poor' made enough efforts to get rid of poverty. No effect on the behavior of either dictator or recipient.
