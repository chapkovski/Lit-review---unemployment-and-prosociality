#On the relation between impulses to help and causes of neediness: An experimental study. \citet{Buitrago_2009}
Two-person game, with inequality of endowments. A 'poor' guy could choose the level of efforts. After that a 'rich' participant played a dictator's game. In some treatments before taking the decision of donation, (s)he could observe if the 'poor' made enough efforts to get rid of poverty. 
##Hypothesis
Expectations that dictators give less to those who show low efforts and willingness to leave the poverty.
##Results
No effect on the behavior of either dictator or recipient.
