##Evidence from an Experiment on Charity to Welfare Recipients: Reciprocity, Altruism and the Empathic Responsiveness Hypothesis \cite{Fong_2007}

* The experiment was an n-donor dictator game in which multiple donors were matched with one real-life welfare recipient.
* There were three recipients (thus 3 distinct treatments). All three recipients were single African-American women with dependent children who did not have full-time jobs, received government assistance, had annual household incomes of less than $25,000, and were less than 55 years old. 
* Three recipients had to fill in a short questionnaire and they differed only in their answers to three final questions, so from the Dictators' point of view they were categorized as:
    * industrious
    * lazy
    * no information (questions were omitted)

Each donor was given a five dollar show-up fee and ten dollars to use in the experiment. Each donor read some information about the recipient, then privately and anonymously gave any amount of the ten dollar pie of his or her choosing – from zero to ten dollars – to the welfare recipient and kept the rest. Each recipient earned the sum of the donations from the donors she was matched with.

All three recipients were single African-American women with dependent children who did not have full-time jobs, received government assistance, had annual household incomes of less than $25,000, and were less than 55 years old.

However, they differed according to their answers to the three final questions on the survey. In one treatment condition, the welfare recipient answered ‘yes’ to all three of these questions (‘industrious’-recipient condition), in another, the recipient answered ‘no’ to all three questions (‘lazy’-recipient condition), and in a third, the last three questions were omitted (low-information condition).

9 If you don't work full-time, are you looking for more work? ______Yes, I am looking for more work. ______No, I am not looking for more work.
10 If it were up to you, would you like to work full-time? ______Yes, I would like to work full-time. ______No, I would not like to work full-time.
11 During the last five years, have you held one job for more than a one-year period? Yes_____ No_____

This article tested the effects of context-rich attitudinal measures of conditional or reciprocal altruism and unconditional altruism on offers in a charity game involving giving to real-life welfare recipients. There was strong evidence of conditional altruism. Attitudinal measures of beliefs that the recipient in the experiment was poor because of bad luck rather than laziness – instrumented by both prior beliefs that bad luck rather than laziness causes poverty and randomly provided direct information about the recipient's attachment to the labour force – have large and very robust positive effects on offers.

The attitudinal measure of unconditional altruism also had significant and robust positive effects on offers in the pooled sample. However, results across treatment conditions exhibited a surprising and very robust pattern that is inconsistent with unconditional altruism. Those who scored high on the humanitarianism measure were highly responsive to the perceived worthiness of recipients. Their median offer to the recipient who appeared industrious was $5.00 out of a $10.00 pie, while the median offer of those who scored low on the measure was only $1.00. In contrast, when the recipient appeared lazy, the median offer from those who scored high on the measure was only $1.00 and did not differ from the median offer of those who scored low on the measure.
