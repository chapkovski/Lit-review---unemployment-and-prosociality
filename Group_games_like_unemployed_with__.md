##Evidence from an Experiment on Charity to Welfare Recipients: Reciprocity, Altruism and the Empathic Responsiveness Hypothesis \cite{Fong_2007}

* The experiment was an n-donor dictator game in which multiple donors were matched with one real-life welfare recipient.
* There were three recipients (thus 3 distinct treatments). All three recipients were single African-American women with dependent children who did not have full-time jobs, received government assistance, had annual household incomes of less than $25,000, and were less than 55 years old. 
* Three recipients had to fill in a short questionnaire and they differed only in their answers to three final questions, so from the Dictators' point of view they were categorized as:
    * industrious
    * lazy
    * no information (questions were omitted)

Each donor was given a five dollar show-up fee and ten dollars to use in the experiment. Each donor read some information about the recipient, then privately and anonymously gave any amount of the ten dollar pie of his or her choosing – from zero to ten dollars – to the welfare recipient and kept the rest. Each recipient earned the sum of the donations from the donors she was matched with.

##results
* randomly provided direct information about the recipient's attachment to the labour force – have large and very robust positive effects on offers.

* average donations to lazy, no-info, and industrios were: 1.8, 	3.2, and 	2.78 correspondigly.

The attitudinal measure of unconditional altruism also had significant and robust positive effects on offers in the pooled sample. However, results across treatment conditions exhibited a surprising and very robust pattern that is inconsistent with unconditional altruism. Those who scored high on the humanitarianism measure were highly responsive to the perceived worthiness of recipients. Their median offer to the recipient who appeared industrious was $5.00 out of a $10.00 pie, while the median offer of those who scored low on the measure was only $1.00. In contrast, when the recipient appeared lazy, the median offer from those who scored high on the measure was only $1.00 and did not differ from the median offer of those who scored low on the measure.
